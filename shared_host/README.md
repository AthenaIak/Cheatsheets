# Shared Host administration

Using a shared host for your website is much cheaper than using a dedicated server.
However, it comes with many limitations.
For example, most shared host plans provide servers that support only PHP and not Python or Java.
If you ask the administrator to install something (e.g. Python), they normally deny this service and advice you to upgrade.
This is understandable because they need to maintain any software that they install.

So, instead of asking the host provider to install certain software or provide extra services, you can do it yourself and be responsible for its maintainance.
This shouldn't be an issue for them, as long as you don't exceed the resources quotas that they have given you (e.g. CPU usage).
